# Portfolio Project Data Analysis Repository

This repository contains all the code and queries that I have created through researching and learning from various sources. The projects I have worked on include:
- Types of data join for analyzing a country dataset using Microsoft SQL.
- Exploratory Data Analysis on COVID-19 using Microsoft SQL.
- Data Visulisation about COVID-19 Deaths and Infection in Tableau. Link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vien.ngo3124/viz/COVID19Infected_Dashboard/Dashboard1
- Summary Stats on Summer Olympics using Microsoft SQL.
- Use cleaning techniques to clean the data in the Nashville Housing dataset.
  
I have placed all the datasets in the 'dataset' file. Due to storage limitations, I have included a link to the drive containing these datasets. 
I will strive to learn and explore more projects to enhance my skills further. Everyone is free to edit and use these projects as they see fit.
